## Extension-Specific Instructions

Inside the `webmunk-ext` directory, you will find a dedicated `README.md` file. It contains:

- Modules used in the extension
- Installation instructions
- Development and testing setup details

Make sure to read it carefully when working on or contributing to the extension.

## Additional Setup: Jitsu, BigQuery & Firebase

For setting up **Jitsu**, **BigQuery**, and **Firebase** integration, refer to the file:

```
jitsu-bigquery-firebase-setup.md
```

This guide will walk you through how to deploy and configure these services, and how to integrate them into your extension using the Jitsu SDK.
